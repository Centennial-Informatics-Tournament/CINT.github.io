                    CHS MUN club. What he lacks in social interactions, he makes up for in experience with competitive programming, being in the Platinum division of USACO.
                    These experiences have lent themselves nicely to the position of problem writer and quality control. In his spare time, he likes to play an ungodly amount
                     of video games and not much else.</p>
